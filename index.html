 <h1>Srilekha Janagam</h1>   
    <h6>Bali Indonesia</h6>
    <p>Bali has been hosting travelers, tourists, <b>adventure seekers</b> and beach bums for a long time.
     The small island has seemingly found the perfect medium between holding strong to its local culture/customs, while catering nonchalantly to outsiders tastes. 
     Visitors will be awestruck by the stunning landscapes, ancient temples and </b>traditional practices</b>; yet they will gladly accept the comforts of modern caf√©s, boutique shopping spots, western eateries and fun, lively bars.
      Bali is an excellent place to experience all the draws and <b>attractions of Asia</b>, without battling through culture shock along the way.The </b>adventures and stunning landscapes caught my insterest!!!</b></p>.
